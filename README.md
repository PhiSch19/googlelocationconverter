# googlelocationconverter
A short Converter for the Google Data you can get from https://takeout.google.com/ to HTML-Files with a Link to https://latlong.net.

This converter uses the following Libraries:

GSON (https://github.com/google/gson/)

GUAVA (https://github.com/google/guava)

LOMBOK (https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok)



Configuration of the Converter is at the moment only possible in the Class Converter.
Here you have to configure the path and source. There are at the moment a few Options, e.g. sorting the links, these you can configurate with the Builder in the Main-Class.
